#
# == Class: rsnapshot
#
# Class for managing snapshot backup configuration. Schedules and retaining 
# periods are handled by the rsnapshot::interval define.
#
# NOTE: This class not yet handle distribution of the backup server's SSH keys.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*snapshot_root*]
#   The directory where backups are placed. Defaults to '/var/backups/rsnapshot'.
# [*excludes*]
#   An array of paths to exclude. Defaults to [ '/tmp', '/media', '/mnt', 
# '/proc', '/sys']. Define as [] to exclude nothing.
# [*backups*]
#   An array containing _tab-separated_ strings containing the backup source and 
#   the backup destination. No default value. See the Examples section for an 
#   example.
# [*retains*]
#   An array containing _tab-separated_ strings containing the retain lines. No 
#   default value. The values have to be defined in order from smallest (hourly) 
#   to largest (yearly) or rsnapshot will produce strange results and possibly 
#   destroy backups during rotation.
# [*crons*]
#   A hash of rsnapshot::cron resources to to realize.
#
# == Examples
#
#   class { 'rsnapshot':
#       snapshot_root => '/var/rsnapshot',
#       excludes => [],
#       backups => ['/etc/						localhost/',
#                   'root@server.domain.com		server/'],
#       retain => ['daily	7',
#                  'weekly	4',
#                  'monthly	6']
#   }
